# Code examples

## Building a tiny example
See the included script ```build_run_example.sh``` as an example of how to build the library
and use it with one toy example, HelloGraph.scala. This example simply creates a
complete directed graph with 100 nodes and prints the number of edges in this graph. You
can run this script by just typing ```examples/build_run_example.sh``` which will
build and run the HelloGraph.scala example with default options. You can also run
other examples for instance by running ```examples/build_run_example.sh RandomWalk 10000```
